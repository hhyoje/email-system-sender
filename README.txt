This project is an email system sender. It uses AngularJs, NodeJs, MySQL, and REST API.
The user inputs a name and email with the frontend, which sends this data to the backend. 
The backend then validates the input and if the data is valid, it is stored into a MySQL 
database and an email is sent to the input email, otherwise an error is thrown, which sends
error data to the frontend. The frontend then displays either a success or anerror message.
